Spindown v0.4.0:
05-04-2009:
  * Added a configuration option that allows you to run the spindown command every cycle, even
    when the disk is already inactive.
  * Added functions to the init file that would take over the lsb functions when they are not
    available.
  * Code cleanup.

04-04-2009:
  * Made a class to keep all the extra functions that used to be in main.
  * Removed includes that weren't used any longer.

03-04-2009:
  * Fixed a security issue that allowed attackers to execute malicious commands as root when the
    configuration file wasn't properly secured.

02-04-2009:
  * Fixed a bug that let spindown display the stats of disks that were not present in the
    system when they were defined in the configuration file with there device name.
  * Fixed another bug that could let spindown hang when SIGPIPE is send but the fifo is never
    opend.

24-03-2009:
  * Previous changelog was wrong: "The status file is now only updated when the daemon receives
    the SIGPOLL." Should have been "... daemon receives the SIGPIPE signal.
  * Fixed Issue 4: Spindown status not showing 80% of time.
      Happend when spindownd wasn't ready with writing to the status file when cat was already
      reading from it. Fixed by reverting back to the fifo.
  * Added a directory to /var/run to keep the 2 files in spindown uses.

Spindown v0.3.0:
15-02-2009:
  * Moved the code that reads the configuration file out of spindown and into main.

13-02-2009:
  * The status file is now only updated when the daemon receives the SIGPOLL.

02-02-2009:
  * Removed unnecessary threads, spindown now runs in exactly one thread, no more, no less.
  * Moved some code that didn't belong in the spindown object to main.cpp (signal handeling,
    commandline parameter parsing, daemon code and writting to files).
  * Init script now follows LSB.

    are ignored.
